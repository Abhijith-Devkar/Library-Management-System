# Library Management System using SQL Project --P2

## Project Overview

**Project Title**: Library Management System  
**Level**: Intermediate  
**Database**: `library1_db`

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Library Management System using SQL. It includes creating and managing tables, performing CRUD operations, and executing advanced SQL queries. The goal is to showcase skills in database design, manipulation, and querying.

 

## Objectives

1. **Set up the Library Management System Database**: Create and populate the database with tables for branches, employees, members, books, issued status, and return status.
2. **CRUD Operations**: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on the data.
3. **CTAS (Create Table As Select)**: Utilize CTAS to create new tables based on query results.
4. **Advanced SQL Queries**: Develop complex queries to analyze and retrieve specific data.

### 1. Database Setup
 

- **Database Creation**: Created a database named `library1_db`.
- **Table Creation**: Created tables for branches, employees, members, books, issued status, and return status. Each table includes relevant columns and relationships.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE library1_db;
 use library1 
CREATE TABLE branch1
(
            branch_id VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,
            manager_id VARCHAR(10),
            branch_address VARCHAR(30),
            contact_no VARCHAR(15)
);


-- Create table "Employee"
 
CREATE TABLE employees1
(
            emp_id VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,
            emp_name VARCHAR(30),
            position VARCHAR(30),
            salary DECIMAL(10,2),
            branch_id VARCHAR(10),
            FOREIGN KEY (branch_id) REFERENCES  branch(branch_id)
);


-- Create table "Members"
 
CREATE TABLE members1
(
            member_id VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,
            member_name VARCHAR(30),
            member_address VARCHAR(30),
            reg_date DATE
);



-- Create table "Books"
 
CREATE TABLE books1
(
            isbn VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
            book_title VARCHAR(80),
            category VARCHAR(30),
            rental_price DECIMAL(10,2),
            status VARCHAR(10),
            author VARCHAR(30),
            publisher VARCHAR(30)
);



-- Create table "IssueStatus"
 
CREATE TABLE issued_status1
(
            issued_id VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,
            issued_member_id VARCHAR(30),
            issued_book_name VARCHAR(80),
            issued_date DATE,
            issued_book_isbn VARCHAR(50),
            issued_emp_id VARCHAR(10),
            FOREIGN KEY (issued_member_id) REFERENCES members(member_id),
            FOREIGN KEY (issued_emp_id) REFERENCES employees(emp_id),
            FOREIGN KEY (issued_book_isbn) REFERENCES books(isbn) 
);



-- Create table "ReturnStatus"
 
CREATE TABLE return_status1
(
            return_id VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,
            issued_id VARCHAR(30),
            return_book_name VARCHAR(80),
            return_date DATE,
            return_book_isbn VARCHAR(50),
            FOREIGN KEY (return_book_isbn) REFERENCES books(isbn)
);

```

### 2. CRUD Operations

- **Create**: Inserted sample records into the `books` table.
- **Read**: Retrieved and displayed data from various tables.
- **Update**: Updated records in the `employees` table.
- **Delete**: Removed records from the `members` table as needed.

**Task 1. Create a New Book Record**
-- "978-1-60129-456-2', 'To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Classic', 6.00, 'yes', 'Harper Lee', 'J.B. Lippincott & Co.')"

```sql
INSERT INTO books1(isbn, book_title, category, rental_price, status, author, publisher)
VALUES('978-1-60129-456-2', 'To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Classic', 6.00, 'yes', 'Harper Lee', 'J.B. Lippincott & Co.');
SELECT * FROM books;
```
**Task 2: Update an Existing Member's Address**

```sql
UPDATE members1
SET member_address = '125 Oak St'
WHERE member_id = 'C103';
```

**Task 3: Delete a Record from the Issued Status Table**
-- Objective: Delete the record with issued_id = 'IS121' from the issued_status table.

```sql
DELETE FROM issued_status1
WHERE   issued_id =   'IS121';
```

**Task 4: Retrieve All Books Issued by a Specific Employee**
-- Objective: Select all books issued by the employee with emp_id = 'E101'.
```sql
SELECT * FROM issued_status1
WHERE issued_emp_id = 'E101'
```


**Task 5: List Members Who Have Issued More Than One Book**
-- Objective: Use GROUP BY to find members who have issued more than one book.

```sql
SELECT
    issued_emp_id,
    COUNT(*)
FROM issued_status1
GROUP BY 1
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
```

### 3. CTAS (Create Table As Select)

- **Task 6: Create Summary Tables**: Used CTAS to generate new tables based on query results - each book and total book_issued_cnt**

```sql
CREATE TABLE book_issued_cnt1 AS
SELECT b.isbn, b.book_title, COUNT(ist.issued_id) AS issue_count
FROM issued_status1 as ist
JOIN books1 as b
ON ist.issued_book_isbn = b.isbn
GROUP BY b.isbn, b.book_title;
```


### 4. Data Analysis & Findings

The following SQL queries were used to address specific questions:

Task 7. **Retrieve All Books in a Specific Category**:

```sql
SELECT * FROM books1
WHERE category = 'Classic';
```

8. **Task 8: Find Total Rental Income by Category**:

```sql
SELECT 
    b.category,
    SUM(b.rental_price),
    COUNT(*)
FROM 
issued_status1 as ist
JOIN
books as b
ON b.isbn = ist.issued_book_isbn
GROUP BY 1
```
 


9. **List Employees with Their Branch Manager's Name and their branch details**:

```sql
SELECT 
    e1.emp_id,
    e1.emp_name,
    e1.position,
    e1.salary,
    b.*,
    e2.emp_name as manager
FROM employees1 as e1
JOIN 
branch1 as b
ON e1.branch_id = b.branch_id    
JOIN
employees1 as e2
ON e2.emp_id = b.manager_id
```

Task 10. **Create a Table of Books with Rental Price Above a Certain Threshold**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE expensive_books1 AS
SELECT * FROM books1
WHERE rental_price > 7.00;
```

Task 11: **Retrieve the List of Books Not Yet Returned**
```sql
SELECT * FROM issued_status1 as ist
LEFT JOIN
return_status1 as rs
ON rs.issued_id = ist.issued_id
WHERE rs.return_id IS NULL;
```
